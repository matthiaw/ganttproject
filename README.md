GanttProject
============

GanttProject is an open-source desktop project scheduling and management tool. This is a forked project from https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject.

The goal of this project is to allow autoplanning, so the gantt-tasks are in length optimized by ressource estimate-to-completion on task and ressource-availability.
